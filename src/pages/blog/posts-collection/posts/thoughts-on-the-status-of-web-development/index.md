Web development is becoming more and more relevant every day, as private
companies, public organisations and even individuals develop ever more
complex (and useful) applications that manage all sorts of processes:
[buying a pair of shoes](http://www.theiconic.com.au/mens-shoes/),
[applying for health insurance](https://www.healthcare.gov/) and even
[purchasing tickets](http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/flight-search/global/en)
for your next international flight.

## The exciting parts

In my opinion, one of the most exciting things happening in the field is the
proliferation of incredibly powerful, cost-effective tools that are at the
disposal of the public. I am referring to tools like cloud application platforms
(e.g. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)), continuous integration services
(e.g. [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)) and so on.

The concepts behind these tools are not new, but the convenience and
affordability they have brought to the community of web development is
remarkable, usually allowing people to develop their skills free of charge
through their _freemium_ models.

On top of that, there is an increasing trend to share code within the community,
not only from individual developers but also from origanisations. It is hard to
find a technology company not sharing interesting solutions on their
[GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

At a more technical level, how all that code comes together without conflicting
with each other is no trivial matter, but tools like [Bower](http://bower.io/)
or [Ender](http://enderjs.com/) are easing the pain that frontend dependency
management used to be.

The steady shift to rich client-side applications in recent years offers
developers the opportunity to create an enhanced user experience with faster,
more responsive sites and meaningful lightweight animations, among other things.
Frameworks like [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) or
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) facilitate that work by providing ways
to organise, extend, and reuse easily testable modules. All these frameworks are
still in a relatively early stage of maturity, so it is my expectation that
their continued improvement will drive the foundation for a better web.

## The necessary specs

Moving onto not so exciting aspects of the field, web developers have already
adopted [CSS3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3) and
[HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) as part of their daily workflow.
AngularJS is designing version 2 using
[ECMAScript 6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Versions) that compiles
into 5.

However, it is worth mentioning that neither of those have final specifications:
only [a few out of over fifty CSS3](http://www.w3.org/TR/#tr_CSS) modules have
been published as recommendations, and HTML5 as well as ECMAScript 6 are still
works in progress. It is easy to get excited about the possibilities for
innovation that new languages bring, but a greater effort and willingness to be
involved will be needed in the coming years.

This ensures that the reality of web development does not fall out of sync with
the specification of the necessary standards to support it.
